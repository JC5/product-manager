This is a fairly basic demonstration of what you can do with the [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/) **[API](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/)**.

## Introduction

This is a web-app, built on Laravel. It requires PHP 8.0. It can help you get an overview of the costs associated with a specific thing, such as your car, your pets or hobbies. It does this by collecting the tags associated with these things and group them according to the type of expense.

## How it works

In your Firefly III installation, tag every product related expense with the `product-SUBJECT-TYPE` tag. For `SUBJECT`, you fill in the thing you wish to track. Use "car" for example. For `TYPE`, you fill in whatever the kind of cost is. Here are some examples:

* `product-car-initial-purchase`
* `product-car-repairs`
* `product-car-maintenance`
* `product-car-gas`

Or maybe:

* `product-washing-machine-initial-purchase`
* `product-washing-machine-soap`

The tool will give you an overview of each subject: for `initial-purchase`, `repairs` and the others the expenses will be listed. Also present is the amount spent per month.

### Initial purchase

Make sure you tag one withdrawal with `product-SUBJECT-initial-purchase`.

## Installation

Download or clone the source, run `composer install`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the APP_KEY (32 chars) and Firefly III API data. Visit your web browser.
